Game: Everlasting Estuary Enterprise

Dream team:

  -Stephen Moss 

  -Theodor Wienert

  -Chandler Amato

  -Matt Ueckermann

Project Goal : UD 2019 Fall semester educational estuary game. Goal is to produce a game that will educate 3rd-5th graders about estuary principles in a fun and entertaining way.

Project Overview : 

  0. Game skeleton : Create a decision tree that influences the following minigames, and an overall score. Decisions are related to estuary principles
  Decision 1 : Players decide whether they should expand the port of the town. Increases spawn rate of ships in the first game
  Decision 2 : Players decide whether to build offshore wind or a natural gas power plant. Changes the spawn rate of fish and crustaceans in         the minigame depending on their decision
  Decision 3 : Players choose whether they will invest in estuary research, which influences the amount of equipment the player has in the next game. 
  
  1. Minigame 1 : Players control a boat moving down a waterway, avoiding obstacles such as rocks and ships that approach the player randomly.  Player can pick up trash to increase score. Dodging the rocks will keep the player from losing score, and game ends after a set amount of time.  Controls are up/down arrows for moving the ship.
  
  2. Minigame 2 : Players take control of a robot that the player moves around and takes pictures of natural species that are supposed to be in the estuary, and uses a net to remove the invasive species, which are both listed in the top left.  Controls are mouse for selecting tool, mouse click for movement, and mouse click on close target for action
  
  3. Minigame 3 : Play as a scientist moving in a randomly generated maze that places probes, collects data, and retrieves probes as quickly as possible until time runs out..  Controls are arrow keys for movement, spacebar for probe placement/pickup
  
 Note: Violet UML diagrams and screenshots are in the UML package.
